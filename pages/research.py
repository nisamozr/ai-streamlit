        This endpoint generates a comprehensive research based on the user query. 
        Our agent searches through multiple research papers and articles to provide in-depth information.

        Due to its comprehensive nature, the process is very time intensive. Thus, it is not feasible to provide the research as a response to this endpoint. 
        We provide a conversation id, which can be used later view the research generated. 
        Endpoint can be used to chat with the agent normally once research is generated.

        To get an instant response on the user query, use our report endpoint which generates a succint, but equally informative answer.
